I was supposed to be on a space expedition 

to Planet X with the purpose of exploring a 

facility abandoned by our men. However, just 

before we reached Planet X, our spacecraft 

was hit by an unknown factor, leaving us to

crash in Planet X ... I am the only survivor 

in this tragic accident. 

But, things do not just end here ...
